![Hi!](https://github.com/nospoone/portfolio/blob/dev/public/meta.png?raw=true)

Simple SPA containing my portfolio. I rebuilt my previous portfolio ([which used outdated tech](https://github.com/nospoone/portfolio-static)) and changed its content around. This version used CRA to bootstrap the project and SCSS instead of LESS. I wish I could've used XO instead of the standard CRA config for linting, but I wasn't going to eject _just_ for this.

You can see the website online [here](https://nospoonemak.es).
